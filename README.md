# Behaviour-Based Biometrical Continuous Authentication in Web Applications

This project contains three executable applications, as follows:

 - React Web Application
 - Spring Boot Application
 - Flask Application

In order to test the developed system, all three should be executed simultaneously.
The React Web Application folder contains further instructions on how to set up the testing environment.
Spring and Flask applications were developed using IntelliJ and PyCharm IDEAs, respectively.

###### Important
To successfully run the web application, a .env.local file must be created containing Google Firebase's credentials. Either obtain them emailing the author to 1919716@brunel.ac.uk or create your own Firebase Authentication application and place your credentinals in the .env.local file.
